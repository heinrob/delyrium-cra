# Delyrium (CRA)

![CI/CD](https://github.com/heinrob/delyrium-cra/workflows/CI/CD/badge.svg)

This project is the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) version of [Delyrium](https://github.com/heinrob/delyrium).
Once the migration from the static site generator Gatsby is done, it will replace the old version.

---

This project generates an interactive website from music sheets noted in the ChordPro format.
The music sheets are loaded from another repository ([@heinrob/lyr-sheets](https://github.com/heinrob/lyr-sheets)).
The sheets can be transposed to any key.
